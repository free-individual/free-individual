## Hi, I am Nikhil Shendage.

Currently in the final year of ongoing degree course with specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I am an aspiring Machine Learning engineer who is passionate about leveraging data to solve tackle real world problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è My toolkit:
Languages: Python, Java.

Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn.

Concepts explored: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Machine Learning.

## üìÇ My Featured Projects:
__F1 Performance Analysis:__ An end-to-end project where I utitlized my Pandas and Matplotlib skills to uncover insights into F1 drivers overall performance. From my research it is concluded that __average points per race__ is a more accurate description of a drivers current performance as compared to the standard total points only system.

__F1 Race Outcome Predictor:__ Built a predictive model with scikit-learn that quantified the relationship between a drivers grid position and their final outcome, achieving a __Mean Absolute Error of ~2.07__
