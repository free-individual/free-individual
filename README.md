## Hi, I am Nikhil Shendage.

Currently, I am in the final year of my degree, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I am an aspiring Machine Learning engineer passionate about leveraging data to tackle real-world problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Toolkit
**Languages:** Python, Java  
**Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn  
**Concepts Explored:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Machine Learning

## üìÇ My Featured Projects

__F1 Performance Analysis__:  
An end-to-end project where I utilized my Pandas and Matplotlib skills to uncover insights into F1 drivers' overall performance. From my research, I concluded that __average points per race__ is a more accurate indicator of a driver's current performance compared to the standard total points system.

__F1 Race Outcome Predictor__:  
Built a predictive model with Scikit-learn that quantified the relationship between a driver's grid position and their final outcome, achieving a __Mean Absolute Error of ~2.07__.
