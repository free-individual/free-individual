### Hi, I am Nikhil Shendage.

I am currently in the final year of my degree course with specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I am an aspiring Machine Learning engineer who is passionate about leveraging data to solve tackle real world problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è My toolkit:
Languages: Python, Java.
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn.

Concepts explored: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Machine Learning.

## üìÇ My Featured Projects:
F1 Performance Analysis: An end-to-end project where I utitlized my Pandas and Matplotlib skills to uncover insights into F1 drivers overall performance. From my research it is concluded that average points per race is a more accurate description of a drivers current performance as compared to the standard total points only system.
F1 Race Outcome Predictor: Built a predictive model with scikit-learn that quantified the relationship between a drivers grid position and their final outcome, achieving a Mean Absolute Error of ~2.07
